# Agent History - Ticket-001

## Session Start: 2025-01-23 [First Session]

### 10:00 - Initial Setup
- Read instructions from `ralphy.md` and `.tickets/AGENTS.md`
- Verified ticket ordering: `ticket-001-nested-ptimeout-support` is the only ticket
- Confirmed 13 backlog tasks exist in ticket-001
- Ready to begin Task 1: Enhance argument parsing to detect nested `ptimeout` commands

### Next Steps
- Start with Subtask 1.1: Modify argparse configuration
- Need to examine current `ptimeout.py` structure first

### Notes for Future Sessions
- Working directory: `/home/linuxdev/Desktop/workshop/studio/ptimeout`
- Focus on nested ptimeout support
- Follow strict task ordering: 1.1 → 1.2 → 2.1 → 2.2 → 3.1 → 3.2
- Remember to update task status to `[-]` when starting work
- Commit immediately after each task passes tests
